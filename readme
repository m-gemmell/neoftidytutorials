#This package is for hosting learnr tutorials related to
# the NOEF tidyverse site/workshop

#Below are the R commands used to create this R package

#For people to run my learnr tutorial the best method is for them to
# load the tutorial
# on their own rstudio setup through an R package
#Therefore I need to create an R package to contain the learnr tut
#Following these instruction:
# https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html

#UPdate devtools if needed
install.packages("devtools")
#Load packages
library("devtools")

#Set wd to directory
setwd("~/Git/")
#Create package
create_package("~/Git/neoftidytutorials")

#This opened a new rstudio window with the package
#Add a git repo to it
library("devtools")
use_git()
#I then added this repo to github via github desktop
#This also restarted rstudio again



#With the package created the learnr directory goes into the inst sub-directory
# Info: https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/articles/publishing.html#r-package
#Created an inst/tutorial diretcory and then added learnr directories into
# that directory

#Ran devtools install
library("devtools")
install()

#From here on I believe I can just add various learnr directories
# to inst/tutorials and push to github to update the package
#Keep in mind I need to reisntall this package when I want to test it


#To run and use package
#Ensure r shiny is up to date as well
install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)

remotes::install_github("m-gemmell/mgtidyverselearnr")
library(mgtidyverselearnr)

library("learnr")
learnr::run_tutorial("mg_tutorial", package = "mgtidyverselearnr")



#To see all available tutorials run the below
learnr::run_tutorial()
